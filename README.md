Title: Analisis Tingkat Akurasi Algoritma K-Nearest Neighbor dan Support Vector Machine Pada Klasifikasi Diabetes 

This project was developed in collaboration with group members, and the overall research outcome has resulted in an upcoming journal publication. The aim of comparing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms is to identify the optimal accuracy for diabetes data. The diabetes dataset used in this study was obtained from the Kaggle platform. [Click this link to download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes).
